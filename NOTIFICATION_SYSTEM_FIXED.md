# Notification System - Implementation Complete âœ…

## Problem
The system was not sending notifications when:
- Users accepted team invitations
- Admins assigned or updated team member roles
- Admins updated team member permissions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Accept Invitation Notification
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/team/accept-invitation/:token`

When a user accepts an invitation, they now receive:
- **Type**: `team_member`
- **Title**: "Welcome to the Team!"
- **Message**: "You've successfully joined [Owner Name]'s team as a [role]. You now have access to the owner portal with your assigned permissions."
- **Link**: `/owner`

### 2. Role Update Notification
**Endpoint**: `PUT /api/owner/team/:memberId/role`

When an admin updates a team member's role, the member receives:
- **Type**: `team_update`
- **Title**: "Your Role Has Been Updated"
- **Message**: "[Admin Name] has updated your role to [role]. Your permissions have been updated accordingly."
- **Link**: `/owner`

### 3. Permission Update Notification
**Endpoint**: `PUT /api/owner/team/:memberId/permissions`

When an admin updates a team member's permissions, the member receives:
- **Type**: `team_update`
- **Title**: "Your Permissions Have Been Updated"
- **Message**: "[Admin Name] has updated your permissions. You now have [count] permission(s)."
- **Link**: `/owner`

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Notification Creation**: When any of the above actions occur, the system automatically inserts a notification into the `notifications` table.

2. **User-Specific**: Notifications are sent to the correct user's `firebase_uid`.

3. **Real-Time**: Notifications appear immediately in the user's notification bell (if they refresh or if you have real-time updates enabled).

4. **Safety Check**: Notifications are only sent if the team member has accepted the invitation (`member_uid` is not null).

## Testing the System

### Test 1: Accept Invitation
1. Admin invites a new user
2. User receives invitation email
3. User clicks "Accept Invitation"
4. âœ… User should see notification: "Welcome to the Team!"

### Test 2: Update Role
1. Admin goes to Team Management
2. Admin updates a team member's role from "viewer" to "editor"
3. âœ… Team member should see notification: "Your Role Has Been Updated"

### Test 3: Update Permissions
1. Admin goes to Team Management
2. Admin adds or removes permissions for a team member
3. âœ… Team member should see notification: "Your Permissions Have Been Updated"

## Database Schema

Notifications are stored in the `notifications` table with:
```sql
firebase_uid VARCHAR(255)  -- User who receives the notification
type VARCHAR(50)           -- 'team_member' or 'team_update'
title VARCHAR(255)         -- Notification title
message TEXT               -- Notification message
link VARCHAR(255)          -- Where to redirect on click
created_at TIMESTAMP       -- When notification was created
is_read BOOLEAN            -- Whether user has read it
```

## Console Logging

The system logs when notifications are sent:
```
ðŸ“¬ Notification sent to user [firebase_uid] about role update to [role]
ðŸ“¬ Notification sent to user [firebase_uid] about permission update
```

## Next Steps

Now when you:
1. âœ… Invite someone and they accept â†’ They get a notification
2. âœ… Update their role â†’ They get a notification
3. âœ… Update their permissions â†’ They get a notification

The notification system is now fully integrated into the team management workflow!

## Notes

- Notifications only work for users who have **accepted** invitations (have `member_uid` set)
- Pending invitations won't trigger notifications until accepted
- All notifications link to `/owner` so users can immediately access their new permissions
