## 🔄 Auto-Refresh Strategies

### Strategy 1: On Login
Permissions fetch immediately when you log in

### Strategy 2: Every 30 Seconds
While on owner pages, auto-refresh runs every 30s

### Strategy 3: On Navigation
When you navigate between owner pages, permissions refresh

### Strategy 4: On Notification
When you get a team notification, instant refresh triggered

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see new permissions"

**Check 1**: Did you receive a notification?
- Look for notification bell icon
- Should have "Your Permissions Have Been Updated"

**Check 2**: Wait 60 seconds
- Notification polling runs every 60 seconds
- Auto-refresh will trigger when notification arrives

**Check 3**: Navigate to another owner page
- Click Users, then Projects, then back to Users
- This triggers navigation-based refresh

**Check 4**: Manual refresh (last resort)
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
- Or `F5` (normal refresh)

### "Sidebar shows wrong items"

Open DevTools console (F12) and look for:
```
✅ Permissions refreshed: {isAdmin: false, permissions: Array(15)}
```

If you see this, permissions are updating correctly.

If you don't see it:
- Check if you're on an `/owner/*` page
- Check console for errors
- Try manual refresh

### "Too many console messages"

This is normal! Logs show system working:
- `🔄 Auto-refreshing...` = 30s timer running
- `🔔 Permission refresh...` = Notification triggered it
- `✅ Permissions refreshed` = Successfully updated

These can be removed in production if desired.
