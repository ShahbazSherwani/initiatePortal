# Dashboard Access Issue - Resolution

## Problem
Users were seeing "Database error" when accessing `/owner/dashboard` as team members (non-admins).

## Root Cause
The `/owner/dashboard` endpoint (`OwnerDashboard.tsx`) makes three API calls:
1. `/api/owner/stats`
2. `/api/owner/recent-projects`
3. `/api/owner/project-insights`

All three endpoints are **admin-only** and return:
```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized: Owner access required" }
```

However, the frontend was catching this as a generic "Database error" and trying to show mock data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend - Better Error Messages
Updated all three dashboard endpoints to return clearer error messages:

**Before**:
```javascript
return res.status(403).json({ error: "Unauthorized: Owner access required" });
```

**After**:
```javascript
console.log(`❌ /api/owner/stats access denied for user: ${firebase_uid} (not admin)`);
return res.status(403).json({ error: "Unauthorized: Admin privileges required for dashboard" });
```

### 2. Frontend - Better Error Handling
Updated `OwnerDashboard.tsx` to detect authorization errors:

**Before**:
```typescript
catch (error) {
  console.error('Error fetching owner data:', error);
  toast.error('Failed to load dashboard data');
  // Always showed mock data
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
catch (error: any) {
  console.error('Error fetching owner data:', error);
  
  // Check if it's an authorization error
  if (error?.message?.includes('Unauthorized') || error?.message?.includes('403')) {
    toast.error('Access denied: Admin privileges required');
    console.error('❌ Dashboard access denied - user is not an admin');
    setLoading(false);
    return; // Don't show mock data for unauthorized users
  }
  
  toast.error('Failed to load dashboard data - using cached data');
  // Only show mock data for genuine errors, not auth failures
}
```

## How It Works Now

### For System Admins (is_admin = true)
1. Navigate to `/owner/dashboard` ✅
2. Dashboard loads successfully ✅
3. All stats, projects, and insights display ✅

### For Team Members (is_admin = false)
1. Navigate to `/owner` ✅
2. `OwnerRedirect` checks permissions ✅
3. **Redirected to** `/owner/projects` or `/owner/users` ✅
4. **Cannot access** `/owner/dashboard` ❌
5. If they try direct URL:
   - `AdminRoute` blocks them ✅
   - OR if they somehow bypass, API returns 403 ✅
   - Frontend shows "Access denied: Admin privileges required" ✅
   - **No mock data shown** ✅

## Why Team Members Can't See Dashboard

The dashboard shows **platform-wide statistics** that only system admins should see:
- Total users (borrowers, investors, guarantors)
- All projects across the platform
- Investment amounts
- Suspended users/projects
- Monthly growth metrics

Team members should only see:
- **Projects page** (if they have `projects.view` permission)
- **Users page** (if they have `users.view` permission)
- **Their specific permissions** - not admin dashboard

## Route Protection

```typescript
// AdminRoute component ensures only admins access dashboard
<Route 
  path="/owner/dashboard" 
  element={
    <AdminRoute>  {/* ← Blocks non-admins */}
      <OwnerDashboard />
    </AdminRoute>
  } 
/>

// OwnerRedirect ensures team members go to permitted pages
<Route path="/owner" element={<OwnerRedirect />} />
// ↑ Redirects admins to /owner/dashboard
// ↑ Redirects team members to /owner/projects or /owner/users
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Admin Access ✅
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to `/owner`
3. Should redirect to `/owner/dashboard`
4. Dashboard should load with real data

### Test 2: Team Member Access ✅
1. Log in as team member (Jim)
2. Go to `/owner`
3. Should redirect to `/owner/projects` (if has projects.view)
4. **Should NOT see dashboard**

### Test 3: Team Member Direct URL ❌
1. Log in as team member (Jim)
2. Type `/owner/dashboard` in URL
3. AdminRoute blocks access
4. Redirected away from dashboard

### Test 4: API Protection ✅
1. Team member somehow bypasses frontend
2. API calls return 403 Unauthorized
3. Frontend shows "Access denied" message
4. No mock data displayed

## Console Logging

### Backend Logs
```bash
❌ /api/owner/stats access denied for user: O2wPRdzv6OfOWdLrR1lGnbdyXSn2 (not admin)
❌ /api/owner/recent-projects access denied for user: O2wPRdzv6OfOWdLrR1lGnbdyXSn2 (not admin)
❌ /api/owner/project-insights access denied for user: O2wPRdzv6OfOWdLrR1lGnbdyXSn2 (not admin)
```

### Frontend Logs
```javascript
❌ Dashboard access denied - user is not an admin
```

## Summary

✅ **Dashboard is admin-only** (by design)  
✅ **Team members redirected to appropriate pages** (projects/users)  
✅ **Clear error messages** instead of generic "Database error"  
✅ **No mock data for unauthorized users**  
✅ **Proper route protection** at multiple levels  

**Result**: Team members can't access the dashboard, and if they try, they get a clear message instead of confusing errors.
