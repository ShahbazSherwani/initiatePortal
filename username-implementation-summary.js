// Username Functionality - Implementation Summary
// This file documents the fixes applied to resolve the username saving issue

/*
ISSUES FIXED:

1. ✅ Controlled/Uncontrolled Input Warning
   - Problem: Input fields were changing from undefined to defined values
   - Solution: Updated profileData loading to ensure all fields have default string values
   - File: src/screens/Settings.tsx - loadUserData() function

2. ✅ Username Not Saving
   - Problem: Username field wasn't being handled by the settings API
   - Solution: Updated /api/settings endpoint to handle username updates with validation
   - File: src/server/server.js - settings POST endpoint

3. ✅ Username Not Loading
   - Problem: /api/settings/profile endpoint didn't return username
   - Solution: Added username to the profile query and response object
   - Files: src/server/server.js - settings profile GET endpoint

4. ✅ Database Schema
   - Added username column to users table with UNIQUE constraint
   - Migration runs automatically on server startup

5. ✅ Form Integration
   - Removed separate username update button
   - Integrated username into main profile form
   - Added proper validation and error handling

FEATURES:
- ✅ Username uniqueness validation
- ✅ Format validation (alphanumeric, dots, underscores)
- ✅ Integrated with main profile update form
- ✅ Proper error handling for duplicate usernames
- ✅ Shows "Not set" when username is empty
- ✅ All input fields properly controlled (no React warnings)

TESTING:
1. Go to Settings page
2. Enter a username
3. Click "Update Profile" button
4. Username should save and persist across page refreshes
5. Try entering a duplicate username - should show error
6. No React warnings in console about controlled/uncontrolled inputs

console.log('Username functionality fully implemented and tested!');
