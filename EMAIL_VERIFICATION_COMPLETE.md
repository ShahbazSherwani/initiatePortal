## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Email Not Received

**Check:**
1. **Spam folder** - GoDaddy emails sometimes go to spam
2. **Email address** - Make sure you entered it correctly
3. **Server logs** - Look for "Verification email sent successfully"
4. **GoDaddy quota** - Check if you hit sending limits

**Solution:**
- Click "Resend Verification Email" button
- Wait 5 minutes for cooldown
- Check spam/junk folder
- Contact GoDaddy support if persistent

### Issue: "Token Invalid or Expired"

**Causes:**
- Token older than 24 hours
- Token already used
- Token doesn't exist in database

**Solution:**
- Go back to `/verification-pending`
- Click "Resend Verification Email"
- Use new link from new email

### Issue: Still Redirected After Verification

**Causes:**
- Browser cache
- Old Firebase token
- Database not updated

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Log out and log back in
3. Check database: `SELECT email_verified FROM users WHERE firebase_uid = '{uid}'`
4. Should be `true`

### Issue: Firebase Quota Exceeded

**Error:** `Firebase: Error (auth/quota-exceeded)`

**Solution:**
- Wait 24 hours (quota resets daily)
- Or upgrade to Firebase Blaze plan
- Use existing accounts for testing

## 📊 Database Queries for Debugging

### Check User Verification Status:
```sql
SELECT 
  firebase_uid,
  full_name,
  email,
  email_verified,
  email_verified_at,
  created_at
FROM users
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Check Verification Tokens:
```sql
SELECT 
  email,
  token,
  verified,
  created_at,
  verified_at,
  expires_at
FROM email_verifications
WHERE firebase_uid = '{uid}'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Manually Verify User (Emergency):
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET 
  email_verified = true,
  email_verified_at = NOW()
WHERE firebase_uid = '{uid}';
```

### Check Pending Verifications:
```sql
SELECT 
  ev.email,
  ev.token,
  ev.created_at,
  ev.expires_at,
  (ev.expires_at < NOW()) as is_expired
FROM email_verifications ev
WHERE ev.verified = false
ORDER BY ev.created_at DESC;
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Needed:
```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtpout.secureserver.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=admin@initiateph.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD={your-godaddy-password}
EMAIL_FROM=admin@initiateph.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Initiate PH

# Frontend URL (IMPORTANT: Update for production)
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
```

### Update Verification Link:
In `src/server/server.js`, the verification link uses `FRONTEND_URL`:
```javascript
const verificationUrl = `${process.env.FRONTEND_URL}/verify-email/${token}`;
```

Make sure `FRONTEND_URL` points to your production domain!
