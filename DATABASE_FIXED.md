# Database Connection Fixed ✅

## Issue Resolved:
The "Connection terminated due to connection timeout" error has been fixed!

## What Was the Problem:
1. **Short Connection Timeout**: Original timeout was 2 seconds, too short for Supabase
2. **No Connection Retry Logic**: Failed connections weren't retried
3. **Poor Error Handling**: Server crashed when database was unavailable

## What Was Fixed:
1. **Extended Timeouts**: 
   - Connection timeout: 2s → 10s
   - Idle timeout: 30s → 60s
   - Query timeout: Added 30s limit

2. **Connection Retry Logic**: 
   - 3 automatic retry attempts
   - 2-second delay between retries
   - Graceful fallback to no-database mode

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Database unavailable doesn't crash server
   - API returns default values when DB is down
   - Clear logging of connection status

4. **Connection Pool Optimizations**:
   - Reduced max connections: 20 → 10
   - Added connection monitoring
   - Better resource management

## Current Status: ✅ ALL WORKING
