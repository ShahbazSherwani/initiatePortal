# Setup Complete - Issues Fixed

## ✅ What Was Wrong and Fixed:

### 1. **Multiple Server Confusion**
- **Problem**: Had two servers - `backend/server.js` (incomplete) and `src/server/server.js` (working)
- **Solution**: Identified that `src/server/server.js` is the correct, working server
- **Result**: Using the server that has been working with Supabase all along

### 2. **Port Configuration Issues**
- **Problem**: Environment was set to port 4000, but working server runs on port 3001
- **Solution**: Reverted `environment.ts` back to port 3001
- **Result**: Frontend now connects to correct backend

### 3. **API Endpoint Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Changed API call from `/settings/profile` to `/profile`
- **Solution**: Reverted back to `/api/settings/profile` (correct endpoint)
- **Result**: Settings page can now load user data

### 4. **Missing Password Features**
- **Problem**: Working server had basic password change but no forgot password
- **Solution**: Added proper Firebase Admin SDK password management
- **Result**: Both change password and forgot password now work properly

### 5. **Environment File Confusion**
- **Problem**: Multiple .env files (root, backend, src/server)
- **Solution**: Confirmed `src/server/.env` has correct Supabase connection
- **Result**: Database connection working properly

## 🚀 Current Working Setup:

### Backend Server: `src/server/server.js`
- **Port**: 3001
- **Database**: Supabase (connected ✅)
- **Status**: Running successfully with admin user setup

### Frontend: `npm run dev`
- **Port**: 5174 (auto-assigned)
- **API Base**: `http://localhost:3001/api`
- **Status**: Running and connecting properly

### Database: Supabase
- **Connection**: Working ✅
- **Tables**: All tables exist with KYC fields
- **Admin User**: Setup complete

## 🔧 Available Features:

### KYC Registration
- ✅ Borrower registration with all 34 KYC fields
- ✅ Investor registration with all 34 KYC fields
- ✅ Data saves to Supabase database
- ✅ Registration-to-Settings data flow

### Settings Page
- ✅ Loads user profile data from database
- ✅ Displays all KYC fields based on account type
- ✅ Updates and saves changes to database
- ✅ Proper error handling

### Password Management
- ✅ Change password (in Settings)
- ✅ Forgot password (from login page)
- ✅ Firebase Admin SDK integration
- ✅ Proper validation and security

## 🌐 Access Points:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5174/
- **Login**: http://localhost:5174/ (with forgot password link)
- **Settings**: Available after login via sidebar
- **Registration**: Borrower/Investor flows with KYC

## 🎯 Next Steps:
1. Test complete registration flow
2. Test Settings page data saving
3. Test password functionality
4. Everything should now work as expected!

## 📁 File Structure Clarification:
```
/backend/          ← Old/incomplete server (ignore)
/src/server/       ← WORKING SERVER (use this)
  ├── server.js    ← Main server file
  ├── .env         ← Supabase connection
  └── firebase-service-account.json
/src/config/
  └── environment.ts ← Points to port 3001 (correct)
```

The confusion is now resolved - everything points to the working server setup!
