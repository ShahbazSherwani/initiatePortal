# Wallet Deduction System Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
The wallet deduction system has been successfully implemented to automatically deduct investment amounts from investor wallets when admins approve investment requests.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Wallet Balance Validation** - Checks investor has sufficient funds before approval
2. **Atomic Transactions** - Uses database transactions to ensure data consistency
3. **Automatic Deduction** - Money is deducted from investor wallet on approval
4. **Funding Meter Updates** - Project funding tracking is updated automatically
5. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
6. **Transaction Rollback** - Failed operations are rolled back to maintain data integrity

### Code Changes Made:

#### 1. Enhanced Admin Investment Approval Endpoint
**File:** `src/server/server.js`
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/projects/:projectId/investments/:investorId/review`

**New Functionality:**
- Wrapped entire approval process in database transaction
- Added wallet balance validation before approval
- Implemented automatic wallet deduction on approval
- Enhanced error handling with transaction rollback
- Added wallet update information in response

#### 2. Key Implementation Logic:

```javascript
// Database transaction for atomic operations
const client = await db.connect();
await client.query('BEGIN');

// Wallet balance validation
const walletResult = await client.query(
  'SELECT balance FROM wallets WHERE firebase_uid = $1',
  [investorId]
);

const currentBalance = walletResult.rows[0]?.balance || 0;

if (currentBalance < approvedAmount) {
  await client.query('ROLLBACK');
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    error: `Cannot approve investment. Insufficient wallet balance`,
    currentBalance,
    requiredAmount: approvedAmount,
    shortfall: approvedAmount - currentBalance
  });
}

// Deduct money from wallet
const deductResult = await client.query(
  `UPDATE wallets 
   SET balance = balance - $1, updated_at = NOW() 
   WHERE firebase_uid = $2
   RETURNING balance`,
  [approvedAmount, investorId]
);

// Update project funding
projectData.funding.totalFunded += approvedAmount;

// Commit transaction
await client.query('COMMIT');
```

## 📋 System Flow

### Investment Process:
1. **Investor Makes Request** → Balance checked but not deducted
2. **Request Pending** → Money remains in investor wallet
3. **Admin Reviews** → System validates current balance
4. **Admin Approves** → Money automatically deducted
5. **Project Updated** → Funding meter increases
6. **Investment Confirmed** → Status updated to 'approved'

### Rejection Process:
1. **Admin Rejects** → No money deducted
2. **Status Updated** → Investment marked as 'rejected'
3. **Wallet Unchanged** → Investor keeps their money

## 🔒 Security Features

### 1. **Double Balance Check**
- Initial check when creating investment request
- Final check when approving (prevents race conditions)

### 2. **Atomic Transactions**
- All database operations in single transaction
- Automatic rollback on any failure
- Prevents partial updates

### 3. **Admin Authorization**
- Only verified admins can approve investments
- Admin UID tracked for audit trail

### 4. **Status Validation**
- Prevents double-processing of investments
- Checks investment is still 'pending' before approval

## ⚠️ Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios:
1. **Insufficient Funds** → Clear error message with balance details
2. **Missing Wallet** → Proper error handling if wallet doesn't exist
3. **Already Processed** → Prevents duplicate processing
4. **Database Errors** → Transaction rollback with error logging
5. **Network Issues** → Comprehensive error responses

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Steps:

#### 1. Setup Test Environment
```bash
# Start the server
cd src/server
node server.js

# Start frontend (separate terminal)
npm run dev
```

#### 2. Create Test Data
1. **Admin Account**: Login as admin (already configured)
2. **Investor Account**: Create new investor profile
3. **Wallet Funding**: Request and approve wallet top-up
4. **Project**: Create and publish a project
5. **Investment**: Make investment request as investor

#### 3. Test Investment Approval
1. Login as admin
2. Go to "Investment Requests" page
3. Approve an investment
4. Verify:
   - Investment status changes to "approved"
   - Investor wallet balance decreases
   - Project funding meter increases
   - Success message shows wallet deduction details

#### 4. Test Error Cases
1. **Insufficient Funds**: Try approving when investor has low balance
2. **Double Processing**: Try approving same investment twice
3. **Database Errors**: Test with invalid project/investor IDs

### API Response Example (Success):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Investment request approved successfully",
  "investment": {
    "investorId": "abc123",
    "amount": 50000,
    "status": "approved",
    "reviewedAt": "2025-09-11T08:00:00.000Z",
    "reviewedBy": "admin123"
  },
  "walletUpdate": {
    "investorId": "abc123",
    "amountDeducted": 50000,
    "newBalance": 150000,
    "deductionProcessed": true
  }
}
```

### API Response Example (Insufficient Funds):
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot approve investment. Investor's current wallet balance (₱25,000) is insufficient for the investment amount (₱50,000)",
  "currentBalance": 25000,
  "requiredAmount": 50000,
  "shortfall": 25000
}
```

## 🚀 Benefits

2. **Wallet Balance**: Refresh after investment approvals
3. **Project Funding**: Update funding meter in real-time
4. **Error Handling**: Display appropriate messages for wallet errors

### Database Schema:
- `wallets` table: balance tracking with timestamps

## 📊 Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
- Wallet balance changes
- Investment approval success rate  
- Transaction rollback frequency
- Error rates by type

### Logs to Watch:
```
💳 Wallet deduction: Deducted ₱50,000 from investor abc123. New balance: ₱150,000
💰 Investment approved: Added ₱50,000 to project 5. Total funded: ₱200,000
❌ Cannot approve investment. Insufficient wallet balance
```

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

The wallet deduction system is now fully implemented and ready for testing. The system ensures financial integrity, proper error handling, and seamless integration with the existing investment approval workflow.

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the system using the manual testing guide
2. Update frontend components to handle new response format
3. Monitor system in production for any edge cases
4. Consider implementing notification system for wallet changes
