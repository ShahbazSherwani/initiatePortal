**Email:** admin@initiateph.com

---

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Verify/Reset Email Password in GoDaddy

1. **Log into GoDaddy:**
   - Go to https://godaddy.com
   - Sign in with your account

2. **Navigate to Email:**
   - Click **"Email & Office"** in your account dashboard
   - Or go directly to: https://account.godaddy.com/products

3. **Find Your Email Account:**
   - Look for **admin@initiateph.com**
   - Click **"Manage"** or **"Manage All"**

4. **Check Email Account Settings:**
   - Click on **"Webmail"** or **"Settings"**
   - Look for the email account **admin@initiateph.com**

5. **Reset the Password:**
   - Click **"Reset Password"** or **"Change Password"**
   - Create a NEW password (write it down!)
   - **Use a simple password for testing** (no special characters like $ initially)
   - Example: `Empire2024Test` (letters and numbers only)

6. **Update .env File:**
   ```properties
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_new_password_here
   ```

---

### Step 2: Verify Email Account is Active

Check that:
- ‚úÖ The email account `admin@initiateph.com` exists
- ‚úÖ It's not suspended or locked
- ‚úÖ You can log into webmail with the password
- ‚úÖ The email plan is active (not expired)

**Test Webmail Login:**
- Go to: https://email.godaddy.com or https://outlook.office365.com/mail
- Try logging in with: `admin@initiateph.com` and your password
- If you can't log in to webmail, the password is definitely wrong

---

### Step 3: Check GoDaddy Email Type

GoDaddy has different email products:

#### Option A: Workspace Email (Most Common)
- **SMTP Server:** `smtpout.secureserver.net`
- **Port:** 465 (SSL) or 587 (TLS)
- **This is what we're using** ‚úÖ

#### Option B: Microsoft 365 Email
If your email is through Microsoft 365/Outlook:
- **SMTP Server:** `smtp.office365.com`
- **Port:** 587
- **Authentication:** Modern Auth might be required

**Check which type you have:**
1. In GoDaddy dashboard, look at your email product name
2. If it says "Microsoft 365" or "Office 365", update your .env:
   ```properties
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.office365.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_SECURE=false
   ```

---

### Step 4: Try Alternative SMTP Settings

If still failing, try these configurations:

#### Configuration 1: Direct SMTP (Workspace Email)
```properties
EMAIL_HOST=smtpout.secureserver.net
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_SECURE=true
EMAIL_USER=admin@initiateph.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
```

#### Configuration 2: STARTTLS (Workspace Email)
```properties
EMAIL_HOST=smtpout.secureserver.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=admin@initiateph.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
```

#### Configuration 3: Alternative Relay
```properties
EMAIL_HOST=relay-hosting.secureserver.net
EMAIL_PORT=25
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=admin@initiateph.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
```

#### Configuration 4: Microsoft 365 (if applicable)
```properties
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.office365.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=admin@initiateph.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
```

---

### Step 5: Password Special Characters

Your current password has `$` which might cause issues in some environments.

**Try:**
1. Escape the $ character: `\$Empire08`
2. Or quote the password: `"$Empire08"`
3. Or use a simpler password without special characters for testing

Update `.env`:
```properties
# Try one of these:
EMAIL_PASSWORD=\$Empire08
# or
EMAIL_PASSWORD="$Empire08"
# or create a new simple password:
EMAIL_PASSWORD=Empire2024Test
```

---

### Step 6: Check Email Account in Control Panel

1. **Log into GoDaddy cPanel/Plesk:**
   - If you have hosting with cPanel, log in there
   - Go to **Email Accounts**
   - Find `admin@initiateph.com`

2. **Verify:**
   - Email account exists
   - No quota exceeded
   - Not suspended
   - Password is set

3. **Test in Email Client:**
   - Set up the email in Outlook/Thunderbird with same settings
   - If it works there, the password is correct

---

## Quick Diagnostic Steps

### Test 1: Can You Access Webmail?
```
Go to: https://email.godaddy.com
Login: admin@initiateph.com
Password: $Empire08
```
**If this fails** ‚Üí Password is wrong, reset it

### Test 2: Check Email Product Type
```
GoDaddy Dashboard ‚Üí Email & Office ‚Üí Check product name
- If "Workspace Email" ‚Üí Use smtpout.secureserver.net
- If "Microsoft 365" ‚Üí Use smtp.office365.com
```

### Test 3: Try Simple Password

(No special characters)
