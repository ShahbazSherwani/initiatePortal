**Why We Are Choosing Vercel and Render Over AWS**

- Simplicity & Developer Experience: Easy setup, automatic deployments, less infrastructure management.
- Cost-Effectiveness: Predictable pricing, no hidden costs, affordable for startups.
- Built-in Features: SSL, CDN, serverless, and global edge delivery included.
- Scalability Without Complexity: Auto-scaling, no manual intervention needed.
- Faster Time to Market: Quick deployments, easy rollbacks, high uptime.
- Team Collaboration: Preview deployments, environment management, team workflows.

*Assumptions: Budget estimates are based on 100,000 users, moderate usage, 2–4 backend instances, 100–500GB storage, and 10,000–50,000 emails/month. For future scaling, if user growth exceeds 100,000 users, we will consider migrating to AWS or another enterprise-grade provider based on actual user count and platform needs. AWS support plan is optional but recommended for production and large-scale operations.*
