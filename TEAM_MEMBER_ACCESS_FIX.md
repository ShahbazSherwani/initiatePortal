# Team Member Access Fix Summary

## Problem
Team members who accepted invitations couldn't access the owner dashboard or any owner pages because:
1. They were redirected to `/owner/dashboard` after accepting invitation
2. All `/owner/*` routes were protected by `AdminRoute` which checks `profile.isAdmin = true`
3. Team members have `is_admin = false` and rely on team permissions instead

## Solution

### 1. Created `TeamOrAdminRoute` Component
A new route guard that allows access for:
- **Admins**: Users with `profile.isAdmin = true` (full access)
- **Team Members**: Users with specific permissions in `team_member_permissions` table

**How it works:**
```tsx
<TeamOrAdminRoute requiredPermission="projects.view">
  <OwnerProjects />
</TeamOrAdminRoute>
```

The component:
1. Checks if user is admin → grants access immediately
2. If not admin, calls `/api/team/my-permissions` endpoint
3. Checks if user has the required permission or wildcard (`*`)
4. Grants/denies access based on permissions

### 2. Updated Routes

**Before** (Admin-only):
```tsx
<AdminRoute>
  <OwnerProjects />
</AdminRoute>
```

**After** (Admin OR Team Member with permission):
```tsx
<TeamOrAdminRoute requiredPermission="projects.view">
  <OwnerProjects />
</TeamOrAdminRoute>
```

**Routes Updated:**
- ✅ `/owner/projects` → requires `projects.view` permission
- ✅ `/owner/projects/:projectId` → requires `projects.view` permission
- ✅ `/owner/users` → requires `users.view` permission
- ✅ `/owner/users/:userId` → requires `users.view` permission

**Routes Still Admin-Only:**
- `/owner/dashboard` → Admin only (team members don't need this)
- `/owner/team` → Admin only (manages team members)
- `/owner/settings` → Admin only (platform settings)

### 3. Fixed Invitation Redirect

**Changed redirect after accepting invitation:**
- **Before**: `/owner/dashboard` (blocked for team members)
- **After**: `/owner/projects` (accessible with `projects.view` permission)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/screens/team/AcceptInvitation.tsx` - Changed redirect destination
- Button text changed from "Go to Dashboard Now" to "View Projects Now"

## Permission System

### Backend Permissions Table
Team member permissions are stored in `team_member_permissions`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE team_member_permissions (
  team_member_id INT REFERENCES team_members(id),
  permission_key VARCHAR(100),  -- e.g., 'projects.view', 'users.view'
  can_access BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);
```

### Current Permission Structure
From the database check, the team member "Menji" has:
- ✅ `projects.view` - Can view projects
- ✅ `users.view` - Can view users

### API Endpoint
`GET /api/team/my-permissions` returns:
```json
{
  "isOwner": false,
  "permissions": ["projects.view", "users.view"]
}
```

Or for admins:
```json
{
  "isOwner": true,
  "permissions": ["*"]  // Wildcard = all permissions
}
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Team Member Access
1. Log in as a team member (e.g., menji@gmail.com)
2. Accept invitation
3. Should redirect to `/owner/projects` ✅
4. Should see projects list (with `projects.view` permission) ✅
5. Navigate to `/owner/users` → should work (with `users.view` permission) ✅
6. Try to access `/owner/dashboard` → should be redirected to /borrow or /investor/discover ✅

### Test 2: Admin Access
1. Log in as admin
2. All `/owner/*` routes should work ✅
3. No permission checks needed (isAdmin = true bypasses all) ✅

### Test 3: Non-Member Access
1. Log in as regular user (not admin, not team member)
2. Try to access `/owner/projects` → should be redirected ✅

## Files Modified

1. **src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx**
   - Added `TeamOrAdminRoute` component
   - Updated `/owner/projects*` routes to use `TeamOrAdminRoute`
   - Updated `/owner/users*` routes to use `TeamOrAdminRoute`

2. **src/screens/team/AcceptInvitation.tsx**
   - Changed redirect from `/owner/dashboard` to `/owner/projects`
   - Updated button text

## Future Enhancements

### 1. More Granular Permissions
Add more permission types:
- `projects.approve` - Can approve/reject projects
- `projects.edit` - Can edit project details
- `users.suspend` - Can suspend users
- `users.edit` - Can edit user details
- `team.manage` - Can manage team members

### 2. Permission-Based UI
Hide/disable UI elements based on permissions:
```tsx
{hasPermission('projects.approve') && (
  <button>Approve Project</button>
)}
```

### 3. Role Templates
Create pre-defined role templates:
- **Viewer**: `projects.view`, `users.view`
- **Editor**: `projects.view`, `projects.edit`, `users.view`
- **Manager**: All permissions except admin-only features

### 4. Permission Context
Create a React context for permissions:
```tsx
const { permissions, hasPermission } = usePermissions();

if (hasPermission('projects.approve')) {
  // Show approve button
}
```

## Current Team Member Status

From database:
- **Email**: menji@gmail.com
- **UID**: F8s1udSigkTLvkpQMnktV4iloZ62
- **Status**: active ✅
- **Role**: member
- **Permissions**: 
  - `projects.view` ✅
  - `users.view` ✅
- **Owner**: Muhammad Shahbaz Khan Sherwani (xd7BTiOlToW9mwFkDCLtZO5dDoY2)

## Summary

✅ Team members can now access owner pages based on their permissions
✅ Admins still have full access to all pages
✅ Invitation acceptance redirects to accessible page
✅ Permission system is extensible for future features
✅ Clean separation between admin-only and team-accessible routes
