# ‚úÖ EMAIL VERIFICATION - DATABASE COLUMN FIX

## Issue Resolved

**Problem:** The `/api/check-email-verification` endpoint was returning 500 error  
**Root Cause:** Endpoints were trying to SELECT `email` column from `users` table, but this column doesn't exist  
**Solution:** Fixed all email verification endpoints to not query the non-existent `email` column

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Database Investigation ‚úÖ
- Confirmed `email_verified` and `email_verified_at` columns exist in `users` table
- Confirmed `email_verifications` table exists with all required columns
- Discovered `users` table does NOT have an `email` column (email is stored in Firebase Auth only)

### 2. Fixed Endpoints

**GET `/api/check-email-verification`**
- **Before:** `SELECT email_verified, email FROM users...`
- **After:** `SELECT email_verified, email_verified_at FROM users...`
- **Change:** Removed query for non-existent `email` column

**POST `/api/send-verification-email`**
- **Before:** `SELECT email, full_name, email_verified FROM users...`
- **After:** `SELECT full_name, email_verified FROM users...`
- **Change:** Get email from request body instead of database
- **Change:** Use `userName` variable (from request or full_name) for email personalization

**POST `/api/resend-verification-email`**
- **Before:** `SELECT email, full_name, email_verified FROM users...`
- **After:** `SELECT full_name, email_verified FROM users...`
- **Added:** Query to get email from `email_verifications` table instead
- **Logic:** Get email from most recent verification record

---

## Database Schema Confirmed

### `users` Table (Relevant Columns):
```sql
- firebase_uid (VARCHAR) - Primary key
- full_name (VARCHAR)
- email_verified (BOOLEAN) DEFAULT FALSE  ‚úÖ
- email_verified_at (TIMESTAMP)  ‚úÖ
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)

NOTE: NO 'email' column - email is in Firebase Auth only
```

### `email_verifications` Table:
```sql
- id (INTEGER) PRIMARY KEY
- firebase_uid (VARCHAR)  ‚úÖ
- email (VARCHAR)  ‚úÖ - Email stored here!
- token (VARCHAR) UNIQUE  ‚úÖ
- verified (BOOLEAN) DEFAULT FALSE
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- verified_at (TIMESTAMP)
- expires_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

## Server Status

```
‚úÖ Server running on port 3001
‚úÖ Email transporter ready (GoDaddy SMTP)
‚úÖ Database connected successfully
‚úÖ All migrations completed
```

## API Endpoints - Now Working

### 1. Check Email Verification
```http
GET /api/check-email-verification
Authorization: Bearer {firebase_token}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "emailVerified": false,
  "verifiedAt": null
}
```

### 2. Send Verification Email
```http
POST /api/send-verification-email
Authorization: Bearer {firebase_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "User Name"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Verification email sent successfully",
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

### 3. Resend Verification Email
```http
POST /api/resend-verification-email
Authorization: Bearer {firebase_token}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Verification email resent successfully"
}
```

**Note:** Gets email from `email_verifications` table

### 4. Verify Email Token
```http
GET /api/verify-email/{token}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Email verified successfully!"
}
```

## Testing Status

### ‚úÖ Ready to Test:

1. **Register New User**
   - Go to `/register`
   - Fill out form
   - Email will be sent to user's inbox

2. **Check Verification Status**
   - Frontend can call `/api/check-email-verification`
   - Will return verification status

3. **Resend Email**
   - User can click "Resend" button
   - Gets email from previous verification record

4. **Verify Email**
   - User clicks link in email
   - Token validated and marked as verified

---

## Files Modified

1. **src/server/server.js**
   - Fixed `GET /api/check-email-verification` (line ~1026)
   - Fixed `POST /api/send-verification-email` (line ~907)
   - Fixed `POST /api/resend-verification-email` (line ~1051)

2. **Created Helper Scripts:**
   - `add-email-columns.cjs` - Verify email columns exist
   - `check-users-email.cjs` - Check user verification status

---

## Important Notes

### Email Storage Strategy:
- **Firebase Auth:** Stores user's email (primary source)
- **Users Table:** Does NOT store email (by design)
- **Email Verifications Table:** Stores email for verification flow

### Why This Works:
1. During registration: Frontend passes email to backend
2. Backend stores email in `email_verifications` table
3. Backend sends verification email
4. For resend: Backend gets email from `email_verifications` table
5. After verification: `users.email_verified` set to `true`

### Data Flow:
```
Firebase Auth (email)
      ‚Üì
Registration Request ‚Üí email in body
      ‚Üì
email_verifications table (stores email + token)
      ‚Üì
Verification Email Sent
      ‚Üì
User Clicks Link
      ‚Üì
users.email_verified = true
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Complete Flow:
```
1. Clear browser data
2. Register new account with real email
3. Check email inbox
4. Click verification link
5. Verify redirects to KYC
6. Complete registration
```

### 2. Monitor Logs:
```
Watch for:
‚úÖ Verification email sent successfully
‚úÖ Email verified successfully
‚ùå Any errors in email sending
```

### 3. Check Database:
```sql
-- Check if user is verified
SELECT firebase_uid, full_name, email_verified, email_verified_at
FROM users
WHERE firebase_uid = 'your-uid';

-- Check verification records
SELECT email, token, verified, created_at, expires_at
FROM email_verifications
WHERE firebase_uid = 'your-uid'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "User not found"
**Cause:** User doesn't exist in database  
**Solution:** Make sure user completed Firebase registration

### Issue: "No verification record found"
**Cause:** No entry in `email_verifications` table  
**Solution:** Register again or check if initial email was sent

### Issue: Email not received
**Cause:** GoDaddy SMTP issue or email in spam  
**Solutions:**
- Check spam folder
- Verify GoDaddy credentials in `.env`
- Run `node test-email.js` to test SMTP
- Check server logs for email errors
